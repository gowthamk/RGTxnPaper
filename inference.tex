\section{Inference}
\label{sec:inference}

Rely-Guarantee framework presented in the previous section facilitates
modular proofs for weakly-isolated transactions, but imposes a
non-trivial annotation burden on the programmer. In particular, it
requires each statement ($c$) of the transaction to be annotated with
a stable pre- ($P$) and post-condition ($Q$), and loops to be
annotated with stable inductive invariants ($\psi$). While weakest
pre-condition style predicate transformers can help in inferring $P$'s
and $Q$'s for regular statements, inferring inductive loop invariants
is still a challenge, even for the simpler form of loops we admit.
Thus, predicate transformer-based approach to proof automation is
unlikely to be effective in this case. We therefore present an
alternative approach to RG proof automation in this section that is
based on state transformers instead of predicate transformers. The
idea is to infer the effect that each statement has on the
transaction-local database state $\stl$ (i.e., how it transforms
$\stl$), and compose multiple such effects together to describe the
effect of the transaction as a whole. Importantly, this approach
generalizes to loops, where the effect of a loop can be inferred as a
well-defined function of the effect of its body, thanks to certain
pleasant properties enjoyed by the database programs modeled by
$\txnimp$.

\input{logic-syntax}

At the core of our approach is a simple language ($\SL$) to express
set transformations shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:logic-syntax}. The language
admits only set expressions that include variables ($x$), literals of
the form $\{x \,|\, \phi^0\}$ where $\phi^0$ is a propositional
(quantifier-free) formula on $x$, a restricted form of existential
quantification that binds a set $x$ satisfying proposition $\phi^0$ in
a set expression $s$, a monadic composition of two set expressions
($s_1$ and $s_2$) using bind ($\bind$), a conditional set expression
where the condition is a propositional formula, and a union of two set
expressions. Symbols $\stl$ and $\stg$ are also variables in $\SL$,
but are used to denote local and database states, respectively.  The
language is carefully chosen to be expressive enough to capture the
semantics of $\txnimp$ statements, yet simple enough to have a
semantics-preserving translation to the first-order logic. 

\input{inference-rules}

Fig.~\ref{fig:inference-rules} shows the syntax-directed inference
rules for $\txnimp$ commands inside a transaction $\C{TXN}_i$.
Inference depends on the $\I$-constrained rely relation $\R$, and the
high-level invariant $I$ for the reasons that will become clear
shortly.  Inference rules compute, for each command $c$, a (meta)
function $\F$ that returns a set as an expression in $\SL$, given a
pair of sets ($\stl$ and $\stg$) that describe local and a global
database states, respectively. The expression returned by
$\F(\stl,\stg)$ (abstractly) describes the set of records that get
added to $\stl$ as a result of executing $c$ under $\stl$ and $\stg$.
Thus, $\F$ captures the \emph{effect} part of the state transformer of
$c$, which is the function $\lambda(\stl,\stg).~\stl \cup
\F(\stl,\stg)$. For $\F$ to be useful in RG verification, it needs to
be stable w.r.t the rely relation $\R$. The stability condition on
effects is defined below:
\begin{smathpar}
\begin{array}{lcl}
  \stable(\R,\F) & \Leftrightarrow & \forall \stl,\stg,\stg'.~
  \R(\stl,\stg,\stg') \Rightarrow \F(\stl,\stg) \equiv \F(\stl,\stg')
\end{array}
\end{smathpar}
Intuitively, the stability condition requires an effect to describe
the same set of records before and after the interference. The
equivalence in $\SL$ translates to the equality in first-order logic,
as will be explained shortly. In the inference rules, stability is
enforced constructively by a meta function $\stabilize{\cdot}$, which
accepts an effect and returns a new effect that is guaranteed to be
stable under $\R$. $\stabilize{\cdot}$ achieves the stability
guarantee by abstracting away the bound $\stg$ in an unstable $\F$ to
an existentially bound $\stg'$ as described below:
\begin{smathpar}
\begin{array}{lcll}
  \stabilize{\F} & = & \F & \texttt{if } \stable(\R,\F).\\
  & = & \lambda (\stl,\stg).~\existsl(\stg',I(\stg'),\F(\stl,\stg')) 
      & \texttt{otherwise. }\stg'\texttt{ is a fresh name.}\\
\end{array}
\end{smathpar}
Observe that when $\F$ is not stable, then $\stabilize{\F}$ returns an
$\F'$ that simply ignores its $\stg$ argument in favor of a generic
$\stg'$, making $\F'$ trivially stable. The existentially bound
$\stg'$ satisfies $I$ since transactions are always executed against a
valid database state. 

The inference rules of SQL statements, like the RG rules, closely
follow the corresponding reduction rules in Fig.~\ref{fig:txnimp},
except that their language of expression is $\SL$. For instance, while
the reduction rule for \C{UPDATE} declaratively specifies the set of
updated records, the inference rule uses $\SL$'s bind operation to
\emph{compute} the set. Other SQL rules do likewise. The inference
rules for \C{LET} binders, conditionals, and sequences compose the
effects inferred for their subcommands. For instance, the effect of a
sequence of commands $c_1;c_2$ is the union of effects $F_1$ and $F_2$
of $c_1$ and $c_2$, respectively, except that $F_2$ is applied to a
state ($\stl$) to which $F_1$ has already been applied, reflecting
their order of reduction. The inference rule for \C{FOREACH} takes
advantage of the $\SL$'s bind operator to lift the effect inferred for
the loop body to the level of the loop. Since records added to $\stl$
in each iteration of \C{FOREACH} are independent of the previous
iteration, sequential composition of the effects of different
iterations is same as their parallel composition. Since the loop body
is executed once per each $z\in x$, the effect of the the loop is the
union of effects ($\F$) for all $z\in x$, all applied to the same
state ($\stl$ and $\stg$). That is, $\F_{loop}(\stl,\stg) =
\bigcup_{z\in x}\F_{body}(\stl,\stg)$. From the definition of
set monad's bind, $\F_{loop}(\stl,\stg) = x \bind (\lambda
z.~F_{body}(\stl,\stg))$, which is what the rule infers.

% \end{array}
% \end{smathpar}
% \caption{A $\txnimp$ program that populates a database
%   of couples.}
% \label{fig:people_code}
% \end{figure}

\begin{example}
Consider a database of couples that tracks the spouse
relationship. Each record has an $\idf$ field, a \C{name} field, and a
spouse id (\C{s\_id}) field. A $\txnimp$ transaction bearing id $i$
that populates the database with a given set ($xs$) of couples will
include the following code snippet:
\begin{smathpar}
\begin{array}{l}
  \foreache{xs}{(\lambda y.\lambda x.~ 
        \updatee{(\lambda z.~ \{\idf=z.\idf;\,\C{name}=z.\C{name};\,
                               \C{s\_id}=x.\idf\})}
                {(\lambda z.~ z.\idf = x.\C{s\_id})};\\
        \hspace*{1.27in} \inserte{x})}
\end{array}
\end{smathpar}
The effect inferred for the program, assuming no interference, is as
following:
\begin{smathpar}
\begin{array}{l}
  \lambda(\stl,\stg).~xs \bind 
    (\lambda x. \stg \bind 
      (\lambda z. \itel{z.\idf = x.\C{s\_id}}
                       {\{\{\idf=z.\idf;\,\C{name}=z.\C{name};\,
                               \C{s\_id}=x.\idf\}\}}
                       {\emptyset}) \\
      \hspace*{1cm} ~\cup~ \{y \,|\, y = \{x \with \delf=false; \}\})
\end{array}
\end{smathpar}
Under the possibility of an interference affecting the stability, the
following stable effect is inferred ($I$ is the database invariant):
\begin{smathpar}
\begin{array}{l}
  \lambda(\stl,\stg).~xs \bind 
    (\lambda x.~\existsl(\stg',I,\stg' \bind 
      (\lambda z. \itel{z.\idf = x.\C{s\_id}}
                       {\{\{\idf=z.\idf;\,\C{name}=z.\C{name};\,
                               \C{s\_id}=x.\idf\}\}}
                       {\emptyset})) \\
      \hspace*{1cm} ~\cup~ \{y \,|\, y = \{x \with \delf=false; \}\})
\end{array}
\end{smathpar}
\end{example}

\subsection{Soundness of Inference}

The correspondence between the inference rules and the RG judgment of
Sec.~\ref{sec:reasoning} is stated thus\footnote{Proof can be found in
the supplementary material}:
\begin{theorem}
\label{thm:inference-sound}
  Forall i,$R$,$I$,$c$,$\F$, if $\stable(\R,I)$ and $c \elabsto \F$,
  then:\\\vspace*{-0.2cm}
  \begin{smathpar}
  \begin{array}{c}
  \R \vdash \hoare{\lambda(\stl,\stg).~\stl=\emptyset \conj
  I(\stg)}{~c~}{\lambda(\stl,\stg).\stl = \F(\emptyset,\stg)}
  \end{array}
  \end{smathpar}
\end{theorem}
Where the set expression $\F(\emptyset,\stg)$ has a natural
interpretation, on the lines discussed in the next sub-section.
% Where, ${\sf true} = \lambda(\stl,\stg).~true$ and $\stable(\R,I)
% \Leftrightarrow \forall\stl,\stg,\stg'. I(\stg) \conj
% \R(\stl,\stg,\stg') \Rightarrow \I(\stg')$.

\subsection{From $\SL$ to the first-order logic}

Theorem~\ref{thm:inference-sound} lets us replace the local judgment
of the \rulelabel{RG-Txn} rule (Fig.~\ref{fig:rg-rules}) by the
inference judgment. The soundness of a transaction's guarantee can now
be established w.r.t the effect $\F$ of the body. The
\rulelabel{RG-Txn} rule updated to use the inference judgment is shown
below:
\begin{smathpar}
\begin{array}{c}
\RULE
{
  \stable(R,\I)\spc
  \stable(R,I)\\
  \R(\stl,\stg,\stg') \Leftrightarrow \I(\C{true},\stl,\stg,\stg') 
        \wedge R(\stg,\stg') \spc
  c \elabsto \F\\
  \R_c(\stl,\stg,\stg') \Leftrightarrow \I(\C{false},\stl,\stg,\stg') 
        \wedge R(\stg,\stg') \spc
  \stable(\R_c,\F)\\
  \forall \stg.~ G(\stg, F(\emptyset,\stg) \gg \stg)\spc
  \forall \stg,\stg'.~I(\stg) \wedge G(\stg,\stg') \Rightarrow I(\stg')\\
}
{
  \rg{I,R}{\ctxn{i}{\I}{c}}{G,I}
}
\end{array}
\end{smathpar}
Since the inference judgment $c\elabsto \F$ is fully automatic,
automating the application of the \rulelabel{RG-Txn} rule for a
transaction now requires automating the multiple implication checks in
the premise. While $R$, $\R$, $\R_c$, $\I$ and $\I$ are formulas in
the first-order logic (FOL) with a relatively simple structure, $\F$
is an expression in the set language $\SL$
(Fig.~\ref{fig:logic-syntax}) with a possibly complex structure.
Fortunately, however, there exists a semantics-preserving translation
from $\SL$ to a restricted subset of first-order logic (FOL) that
lends itself to automatic reasoning. 

The algorithm ($\mssemof{\cdot}$) shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:logic}
encodes an $\SL$ expression in a FOL. Given a set expression $s$ of
$\SL$, $\mssemof{s}$ is a pair $(\phi,f)$, where $\phi$ encodes $s$ in
FOL, and $f$ is a boolean function that names the set defined by $s$.
Naming provides an easy handle to $s$, simplifying $\mssemof{\cdot}$.
Set variables ($x$, $\stl$, $\stg$, $\dots$) are encoded as
unconstrained boolean functions ($g_x$, $g_{\stl}$, $g_{\stg}$,
$\ldots$) that are named after the variable.  Encoding of a set
literal $\{a\,|\,\varphi\}$ introduces a new boolean function $g$ that
is $true$ for only those $a$ that satisfy $\varphi$.  Thus $g$
faithfully encodes the literal. The encoding of the $\existsl{}$
expression first eliminates the second-order quantification over sets.
Existentially bound set variable ($a$) is skolemized, i.e.,
instantiated with a new unbound variable $a'$, before encoding the
bound expression $s$ and the first-order constraint $\phi$. The
algorithm for encoding $\phi$, which is already a first-order formula,
is straightforward. It basically involves replacing set variables with
boolean functions named after the variables. The first-order encoding
for a bind expression describes the semantics of set monad's $\bind$
in FOL. Let $s_1$ be a set, and let $f$ be a function that maps each
variable in $s_1$ to a new set. Then, $s_2 = s_1 \bind f$ if and only
if for all $y\in s_2$, there exists an $x \in s_1$ such that $y =
f(x)$, and forall $x\in s_1$, $f(x)\in s_2$. The encoding adds new
constraints to this effect. Conditional set expressions and set union
are encoded straightforwardly.

Observe that the language of encoding shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:logic} is
a subset of logic that satisfies the following syntactic properties:
\begin{itemize}
  \item All quantification is first-order; second-order objects, such
    as sets and functions, are never quantified.
  \item Quantifiers appear only at the prenex position, i.e., at the
    beginning of a quantified formula.  
  \item All function symbols, modulo those that might appear in
    $\varphi\in\Prop^0$, are uninterpreted and boolean.
\end{itemize}
The fragment of FOL that satisfies the above syntactic conditions is
called Effectively Propositional first-order logic (denoted {\sf
EPR}), or Bernay-Sch{\"o}nfinkel-Ramsey (BSR) logic, which is known to
be decidable~\cite{z3epr}. The language of encoding, however, is a
combination of {\sf EPR} with (a). $\Prop^0$, the theory from which
quantifier-free propositions ($\varphi$) that encode object language
expressions are drawn, and (b).  $\Prop^1$, the theory from which
invariants ($I$) are drawn. We write $\SL[\Prop^0,\Prop^1]$ to
highlight the parameterization of $\SL$ on $\Prop^0$ and $\Prop^1$,
and state the following theorem:
\begin{theorem}
  $\SL[\Prop^0,\Prop^1]$ is decidable if ${\sf EPR}+\Prop^0+\Prop^1$
  is decidable.
\end{theorem}
A useful instantiation of $\SL$ is $\SL[{\sf SLA},{\sf EPR}+{\sf
SLA}]$, where ${\sf SLA}$ is the theory of simple linear arithmetic.
{\sf EPR}+{\sf SLA} is known to be decidable~\cite{eprsla}, hence:
\begin{theorem}
  $\SL[{\sf SLA},{\sf EPR}]$ is decidable.
\end{theorem}
The $\SL[{\sf SLA},{\sf EPR}+{\sf SLA}]$ instantiation requires $I$ to
be drawn from {\sf EPR}+{\sf SLA}, which is expressive enough to
describe common database integrity constraints, such as referential
integrity, non-negativeness of all integer values in a column etc.
Isolation specifications presented in Sec.~\ref{sec:isolation} are
already simple first-order formulas that can be encoded in {\sf EPR}.
Furthermore, it is also reasonable to expect the guarantee ($G$) of a
transaction to be expressible in the same logic as its inferred $\F$,
since $\F$ (without the stability check) is essentially a complete
characterization of the transaction, while $G$ is only an abstraction.
Thus, with $\SL[{\sf SLA},{\sf EPR}+{\sf SLA}]$ as the language of
inference, the verification problem for weakly isolated transactions
is decidable. Moreover, off-the-shelf SMT solvers (e.g., Z3) are
equipped with efficient decision procedures for ${\sf EPR}+{\sf SLA}$
fragment, making the verification a practical exercise.
