\section{Introduction}

Database transactions allow users to group operations on multiple
objects into a coherent unit with useful properties including
atomicity, consistency, (serializable) isolation and durability
(ACID). ACID has been the \emph{de facto} standard for database
transactions for many decades, providing programmers with a simple
implementation-independent model to reason about concurrent
transactions. However, achieving serializability, the ACID-prescribed
standard for isolation, requires databases to severely restrict
concurrency, which brings down the overall throughput of the system.
