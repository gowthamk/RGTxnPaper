% ISOLATION SPECS
% ---------------
\input{iso-specs}

We now describe specifications of standard isolation guarantees
expressed as constraints over trace well-formedness. For brevity and
convenience, we adopt few notations in this and subsequent sections.
An execution trace is destructed as ($\A$,$\visZ$) whenever individual
components of the pair are needed. Otherwise, it is written as $\E$.
Sometimes, the dot notation (\eg~$\E.\A$) is also used. Since $\A$ and
$\visZ$ are both sets, we lift the operations on sets to pairs of sets
when updating $\E$. For example, $\E' = \E \cup
(\{\eta_2\},\{(\eta_1,\eta_2)\})$ expands to $\E' = (\E.\A \cup
\{\eta_2\},\,\E.\visZ \cup \{(\eta_1,\eta_2)\})$.  When $\psi$ is a
formula, $\underE{\psi}$ denotes the interpretation of $\psi$ in the
context of the trace $\E$. Such interpretations are defined on a
case-by-case basis in Figs.~\ref{fig:rel-defs}
and~\ref{fig:ansi-isolation}. 

Fig.~\ref{fig:rel-defs} shows various relations defined over elements
in a trace. In the context of a trace $(\A,\visZ)$, an effect $\eta$
is said to belong to a transaction $T_i$ if $\eta$ belongs to the
effect set $A$ and its transaction identifier is $T_i$. The
containment relation is trivially lifted to the set of effects to
define $\underE{S \subseteq T_i}$.  Visibility and session order
relations are denoted by $\eta_1 \visar \eta_2$ and $\eta_1 \soar
\eta_2$, respectively. A transaction $T_i$ is said to be visible to an
effect $\eta$ if every effect $\eta_1$ of $T_i$ recorded by the trace
is visible to $\eta$.  $T_i$ may be visible to $\eta$ but may not be
visible to every other effect in the $\txn(\eta)$. For a transaction
$T_i$ to be considered to be visible to a transaction $T_j$ in the
context of a trace $\E$ (written $\underE{T_i \visar T_j}$), every
effect ($\eta_1$) of $T_i$ present in $\E$ must be visible to every
effect ($\eta_2$) of $T_j$ in $\E$.  Conversely, if none of the
effects of $T_i$ present in $\E$ are visible to any effect of $T_j$,
then $T_i$ is considered invisible to $T_j$ under $\E$ (written
$\underE{T_i \invisar T_j}$). Transaction $T_i$ is said to have
written to a variable $X$ under $\E$ (i.e., $\underE{T_i \wrstoar X}$)
if there exists a write-to-$X$ effect from $T_i$ in $\E$.
\emph{Reads-from} ($\underE{T_i \rdsfmar X}$) is defined similarly.
$T_i \usesar X$ if it reads or writes $X$.

Fig.~\ref{fig:ansi-isolation} shows various isolation guarantees
defined as propositions indexed by transaction identifiers.
Transaction $T_j$ is said to have experienced \emph{read-my-writes}
visibility under $\E$ if every effect ($\eta_1$) of $T_j$ is visible
to every subsequent effect ($\eta_2$) of the same transaction in $\E$.
This lets $T_j$ to never lose its own updates. Monotonic visibility
adds one more constraint to read-my-writes; besides requiring $\eta_1$
to be visible to $\eta_2$, it also requires every effect ($\eta$)
visible to $\eta_1$ in $\E$ to be visible to $\eta_2$ as well. Thus,
later operations in a transaction witness at least the same set of
effects witnessed by the earlier operations, if not more (hence,
``monotonic'' visibility). Atomic visibility allows an effect
$\eta_2$ of $T_j$ to witness an effect $\eta_1$ of $T_i$ only if all
effects of $T_i$ in $\E$ are also visible to $\eta_2$. Atomic
visibility thus prevents a transaction from being partially visible.
However, atomic visibility does not prevent an uncommitted transaction
from being visible. This is addressed by \C{CommitVis}, which requires
the commit effect of $T_i$ to be visible whenever any effect of $T_i$
is visible.

The ANSI SQL 92 standard requires \iso{Read Committed} isolation to
avoid the dirty reads phenomenon, which is achieved by enforcing
$\mathtt{AtomicVis}$ and $\mathtt{CommitVis}$ guarantees. The {\sc rc}
specification\footnote{Note the distinction in fonts: {\sc rc} is an
abbreviation of \iso{Read Committted}, whereas \C{RC} is its
specification.} (\C{RC}) is therefore a combination of these two
guarantees. The specification also agrees with the description and
implementation~\cite{bailishat,pldi15} of {\sc rc} for highly
available replicated stores. On relational databases, however, {\sc
rc} has also come to be associated with the $\mathtt{MonotonicVis}$
guarantee.  Nonetheless, $\mathtt{AtomicVis}$ and $\mathtt{CommitVis}$
are sufficient to reason about {\sc rc} isolation on relational stores
too. The combination of these guarantees with the {\sc sc} property of
relational stores (formalized in \S\ref{sec:store-consistency})
automatically leads to the monotonicity guarantee, which explains why
{\sc rc} comes with $\mathtt{MonotonicVis}$ on such stores regardless
of the implementation. On weakly consistent stores however,
$\mathtt{AtomicVis}$ and $\mathtt{CommitVis}$ do not imply
$\mathtt{MonotonicVis}$. A stronger isolation level called
\iso{Monotonic Atomic View} ({\sc mav} of
Fig.~\ref{fig:ansi-isolation})~\cite{bailishat} was proposed to
explicitly extend {\sc rc} with monotonicity on such stores.

Snapshot visibility (\C{SnapshotVis}) captures the scenario where a
transaction executes against a static snapshot of the database.  A
transaction $T_i$ is said to be snapshot-visible to a transaction
$T_j$ if either it is visible to $T_j$ (i.e., $T_i$ is included in the
snapshot), or it is invisible (i.e., it is not included); it is
forbidden for only a suffix (more generally, a subset) of $T_j$ to
witness $T_i$. \iso{Repeatable Read} ({\sc rr}) isolation extends {\sc
mav} with the snapshot visibility guarantee.  Observe that snapshot
visibility permits $T_i$ and $T_j$ to execute and commit while being
oblivious of each other. This scenario is captured in
Fig.~\ref{fig:ansi-iso-eg-rr}, where transactions $T_1$ and $T_2$,
which perform conflicting writes, execute against a snapshot of the
database and commit concurrently. While the actual values read and
written by $T_1$ and $T_2$ are unimportant (hence, elided), it is
important to note the \emph{absence} of visiblity arrows from $T_2$ to
$T_1$, although $T_2$ commits before $T_1$'s read-from-$Y$.

\iso{Snapshot Isolation} ({\sc si}) proscribes this possibility. If
$T_i$ and $T_j$ both write to the same shared variable, then {\sc si}
insists that either $T_i$ be visible to $T_j$, or $T_j$ be visible to
the conflicting write of $T_i$ (this is captured by the auxiliary
definition \C{SnapshotSER}). Fig.~\ref{fig:ansi-iso-eg-si} shows an
execution where {\sc si} transaction $T_1$ witnesses a snapshot of the
database that doesn't include $T_2$. Due to \C{SI($T_1$)}, the
conflicting write to $X$ in $T_2$ is now required to witness $T_1$, as
captured by the direction of the $\visZ$ arrow (subsequent operations
also witness $T_1$ because $T_2$ is executing under {\sc mav}).
Lastly, \iso{Serializable} isolation extends $\mathtt{SnapshotSER}$ to
also cover non-conflicting transactions that write to variables read
in the current transaction.  Fig.~\ref{fig:ansi-iso-eg-ser} shows an
execution of an {\sc ser} transaction $T_3$ and a {\sc mav
transaction} $T_4$, which write to $X$ and $Y$, respectively. The
snapshot witnessed by the {\sc ser} transaction $T_3$ does not include
$T_4$, but the write to $Y$ in $T_4$, although non-conflicting,
witnesses $T_1$ because $Y$ is read by $T_1$. Visibility includes
other operations of $T_4$ because of {\sc mav}.

% Note that both $\mathtt{SnapshotVis}$ and $\mathtt{OneWaySER}$
% are asymmetric definitions that guarantee complete visiblity or
% invisibility of $T_i$ to $T_j$, but not the converse. While
% $\mathtt{SnapshotVis}$ provides no guarantees to $T_i$,
% $\mathtt{OneWaySER}$ guarantees that at least the commit effect of
% $T_i$ witnesses $T_j$. 

% \iso{Snapshot Isolation} spec ({\sc si}) extends {\sc rr} with a
% one-way serializability guarantee w.r.t. the transactions that perform
% conflicting writes (i.e., writes to the same shared variable).
% \footnote{Fig.~\ref{fig:ansi-isolation} presents slightly
% weaker versions of {\sc si} and {\sc ser} specs in the interest of
% clarity.}. Fig.~\ref{fig:ansi-iso-eg} shows sample executions of
% transactions $T_1$ and $T_2$. Both transactions read and write to
% shared variables $X$ and $Y$. In the first execution, $T_2$ commits
% while $T_1$ is still in progress, but {\sc rr} isolation prevents
% $T_1$ from witnessing the writes of $T_2$. In the second execution,

%% SJ: Not sure this paragraph is necessary here.
%% In contrast to recent proposals (\emph{e.g.},
%% ~\cite{gotsmanconcur15}), our specifications for {\sc si} and {\sc
%%   ser} do not necessarily impose a total order among transactions
%% (conflicting or otherwise). In reality, a total order under {\sc ser}
%% (resp. {\sc si}) is guaranteed only if the store executes all
%% transactions under {\sc ser} (resp. {\sc si}) isolation. Our
%% specifications admit this possibility, and derive a total order under
%% the assumption of homogenity. However, databases almost always allow
%% isolation levels to be configured on a per-transaction basis, allowing
%% transactions at various isolation levels to coexist.  Specifications
%% that assume homogenity are incorrect under this setting.

% Having specified isolation levels as trace well-formedness
% constraints, we can now construct trace invariants ($\I$) for
% \txnimp programs by composing isolation specifications for various
% transactions. For instance, the following trace invariant enforces
% {\sc si} for both transactions of the program in
% Fig.~\ref{fig:motiv-eg-1}, allowing it to satisfy its postcondition:
% \begin{smathpar}
% \I \;=\; \lambda\E.~ \underE{\C{SI(Wd1)}} \conj \underE{\C{SI(Wd2)}}
% \end{smathpar}
% In contrast, the following trace invariant enforces {\sc rc} for one and {\sc si}
% for another, leading to a possible violation of the postcondition:
% \begin{smathpar}
% \I \;=\; \lambda\E.~ \underE{\C{RC(Wd1)}} \conj \underE{\C{SI(Wd2)}}
% \end{smathpar}
