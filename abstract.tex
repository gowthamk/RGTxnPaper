  Serializability is a well-understood mechanism that simplifies
  reasoning about the behavior of concurrent transactions by ensuring
  an executing transaction is \emph{isolated} from the effects of
  other concurrenty executing transactions once it begins executing.
  However, enforcing serializabity comes at the cost in performance
  because it necessarily restricts opportunities to exploit
  concurrency even when such opportunities would not violate
  application-specific invariants.
  
  As a result, database systems (in practice) support, and often
  encourage, developers to use weaker alternatives.  Generally, these
  alternatives break the strong isolation guarantees provided by
  serializable transactions to permit greater concurrency.
  Unfortunately, the semantics of weak isolation is often poorly
  understood, and usually explained only informally in terms of
  low-level implementation artifacts.  Consequently, verifying
  high-level correctness properties in such environments is
  challenging.

  To address this issue, this paper presents a program logic that
  enables compositional reasoning about the behavior of concurrently
  executing weakly isolated transactions.  Notably, our development is
  parametric over a transaction's specific isolation semantics, and
  the consistency guarantees provided by the underlying data store,
  allowing it to be applicable over a large range of concurrency
  control mechanisms.  Case studies and experiments on real-world
  applications demonstrate the utility of our approach, and provide
  strong evidence that weakly isolated transactions can be placed on
  the same formal footing as their strongly-isolated serializable
  counterparts.
