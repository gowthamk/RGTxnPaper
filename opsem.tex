\input{txnimp}

Fig.~\ref{fig:txnimp} shows the syntax and small-step semantics of
\txnimp, a core language that we use to formalize our intuitions about
reasoning under weak isolation. Variables ($x$), integer and Boolean
constants ($k$), records ($r$) of named constants, sets ($s$) of such
records, arithmetic and boolean expressions ($e_1 \odot e_2$), and
record expressions ($\{\bar{f}=\bar{e}\}$) constitute the syntactic
class of expressions ($e$). Commands ($c$) include $\cskip$,
conditional statements, \C{LET} constructs to bind names, \C{FOREACH}
loops, SQL statements, their sequential composition ($c_1;c_2$), and
transactions ($\ctxn{i}{\I}{c}$) and their parallel composition
($c_1\,||\,c_2$). Each transaction is assumed to have a unique
identifier $i$, and executes at the top-level; our semantics does not
supported nested transactions. The $\I$ in the \C{TXN} block syntax is
the transaction's isolation specification, whose purpose is explained
below.  Certain terms that only appear at run-time are also present in
$c$.  These include a {\sf txn} block tagged with sets ($\stl$ and
$\stg$) of records representing local and global database state, and a
runtime {\sf foreach} expression that keeps track of the set ($s_1$)
of items already iterated, and the set ($s_2$) of items yet to be
iterated. Note that the surface-level syntax of the \C{FOREACH}
command shown here is slightly different from the one used in previous
sections; its higher-order function has two arguments, $y$ and $z$,
which are invoked (during the reduction) with the set of
already-iterated items, and the current item, respectively. This form
of \C{FOREACH} lends itself to inductive reasoning that will be useful
for verification (Sec.~\ref{sec:reasoning}).

% also We let $T_i$ for $i \in \matshbb{N}$
% range over transaction identifiers. When it is evident we are
% referring to a transaction, we use the number $i$ instead of $T_i$ for
% identification (\eg in $\C{txn}\langle i \rangle$). Like variables,
% transaction identifiers are globally accessible. For notational
% convenience, we let $t$ range over both expressions and commands.

We define a small-step operational semantics for this language in
terms of an abstract machine that executes a command, and updates
either a transaction-local ($\stl$), or global ($\stg$) database, both
of which are modeled as a set of records of a pre-defined type, i.e.,
they all belong to a single table.  The generalization to multiple
tables is straightforward. The semantics assumes that  records in
$\stg$ can be uniquely identified via their $\idf$ field, and
enforces this property wherever necessary. Certain hidden fields are
treated specially by the operational semantics, and they are hidden
from the surface language. These include a $\txnf$ field that tracks
the identifier of the transaction that last updated the record, and a
$\delf$ field that flags deleted records in $\stl$.  For a set $S$ of
records, we define $\dom(S)$ as the set of unique ids of all records
in $S$. Thus $|\dom(\stg)| = |\stg|$. During its execution, a
transaction may write to multiple records in $\stg$. Atomicity
dictates that such writes should not be visible in $\stg$ until the
transaction commits. We therefore associate each transaction with a
local database ($\stl$) that stores such uncommitted
records\footnote{While SQL's \C{UPDATE} admits writes at the
  granularity of record fields, most popular databases enforce
  record-level locking, allowing us to think of ``uncommitted writes''
  as ``uncommitted records''. }. Uncommitted records include deleted
records, whose $\delf$ field is set to \C{true}. When the transaction
commits, its local database is atomically \emph{flushed} to the global
database, committing these heretofore uncommitted records. The flush
operation ($\gg$) is defined as follows:
\begin{smathpar}
\begin{array}{c}
\forall r.~ r \in (\stl\gg\stg) ~\Leftrightarrow~ 
  (r.\idf \notin \dom(\stl) \conj r \in \stg)
\disj (r \in \stl \conj \neg r.\delf) 
\end{array}
\end{smathpar}
Let $\stg' = \stl\gg\stg$. A record $r$ belongs to $\stg'$ iff it
belongs to $\stg$ and has not been updated in $\stl$, i.e., $r.\idf
\notin \dom(\stl)$, or it belongs to $\stl$, i.e., it is either a new
record, or an updated version of an old record, provided the update is
not a deletion ($\neg r.\delf$).  Besides the commit, flush also helps
a transaction read its own writes. Intuitively, the result of a read
operation inside a transaction must be computed on the database
resulting from flushing the current local state ($\stl$) to the global
state ($\stg$). The abstract machine of Fig.~\ref{fig:txnimp},
however, does not let a transaction read its own writes. This
simplifies the semantics, without losing any generality, since
substituting $\stl\gg\stg$ for $\stg$ at select places in the
reduction rules effectively allows reads of uncommitted transaction
writes to be realized.

The small-step semantics is stratified into a transaction-local
reduction relation, and a top-level reduction relation. The
transaction-local relation ($\stg \vdash (c,\stl) \stepsto
(c',\stl')$) defines a small-step reduction for a command inside a
transaction, when the database state is $\stg$; the command $c$
reduces to $c'$, while updating the transaction-local database $\stl$
to $\stl'$. The definition assumes a meta-function $\eval$ that
evaluates closed terms to values. The reduction relation for SQL
statements is defined straightforwardly. \C{INSERT} adds a new record
to $\stl$ after checking the uniqueness of its id. \C{DELETE} finds
the records in $\stg$ that match the search criteria defined by its
Boolean function argument, and adds the records to $\stl$ after
marking them for deletion. \C{SELECT} bounds the name introduced by
\C{LET} to the set of records from $\stg$ that match the search
criteria, and then executes the bound command $c$. \C{UPDATE} uses its
first function argument to compute the updated version of the records
that match the search criteria defined by its second function
argument. Updated records are added to $\stl$.

The reduction of \C{FOREACH} starts by first converting it to its
run-time form to keep track of iterated items ($s_1$), as well as
yet-to-be-iterated items ($s_2$).  Iteration involves invoking its
function argument with $s_1$ and the current element $x$ (note:
$\uplus$ in $\{x\} \uplus s_2$ denotes a disjoint union). The
reduction ends when $s_2$ becomes empty. The reduction rules for
conditionals, \C{LET} binders, and sequences are standard, and
ommitted for brevity.

The top-level reduction relation defines the small-step semantics of
transactions, and their parallel composition. A transaction comes
tagged with an isolation specification $\I$, which has two components
$\I_e$ and $\I_c$, that dictate the timing and nature of interferences
that the transaction can witness, during its execution ($\I_e$), and
when it is about to commit ($\I_c$).  Formally, $\I_e$ and $\I_c$ are
predicates over the (current) transaction-local database state
($\stl$), the state ($\stg$) of the global database when the
transaction last took a step, and the current state ($\stg'$) of the
global database.  Intuitively, $\stg'\neq\stg$ indicates an
interference from another concurrent transaction, and the predicates
$\I_e$ and $\I_c$ decide if this interference is allowed or not,
taking into account the local database state ($\stl$). For instance,
as described in \S\ref{sec:motivation}, an SI transaction on
PostgreSQL defines $\I$ as follows:
\begin{smathpar}
\begin{array}{lcl}
\I_e\,\,(\stl,\stg,\stg') & = & \stg' = \stg\\
\I_c\,\,(\stl,\stg,\stg') & = & \forall(r\in\stl)(r'\in\stg).~ r'.\idf = r.\idf \Rightarrow r'\in\stg'.
\end{array}
\end{smathpar}
To simplify the presentation, we use $\I$ instead of $\I_e$ and $\I_c$
when its destructed form is not required.

The reduction of a $\ctxn{i}{\I}{c}$ begins by first converting it to
its run-time form $\ctxnr{i}{\I,\stl,\stg}{c}$, where $\stl =
\emptyset$, and $\stg$ is the current (global) database.  Rule
\rulelabel{E-Txn} reduces $\ctxnr{i}{\I,\stl,\stg}{c}$ under a
database state ($\stg'$), only if the transaction-body isolation
specification ($\I_e$) allows the interference between $\stg$ and
$\stg'$. Rule \rulelabel{E-Commit} commits the transaction
$\ctxnr{i}{\I,\stl,\stg}{c}$ by flushing its uncommitted records to
the database. This is done only if the interference between $\stg$ and
$\stg'$ is allowed at the commit point by the isolation specification
($\I_c$).  The distinction between $\I_e$ and $\I_c$ allows us to
model the snapshot semantics of realistic isolation levels that
isolate a transaction from interference during its execution, but
expose interferences at the commit point.

\textbf{Local Context Independence} As mentioned previously, our
operational semantics does not let a transaction read its own writes.
It also does not let a transaction overwrite its own writes, due to
the premise $\dom(\stl)\cap\dom(s) = \emptyset$ on the
\rulelabel{E-Delete} and \rulelabel{E-Update} rules. We refer to this
restriction as \emph{local context independence}.  This restriction is
easy to relax in the operational semantics and the reasoning framework
presented in the next section; our inference procedure described in
\S\ref{sec:inference}, however, has a non-trivial dependence on
this assumption. Nonetheless, we have encountered few instances in
practice where enforcing local context independence turns out to be a
severe restriction. Indeed, all 17 transactions in the TPC-C and TPC-E
benchmarks satisfy this assumption.
