Fig.~\ref{fig:txnimp} shows the syntax and small-step semantics of
\txnimp, a core language that we use to formalize our intuitions about
reasoning under weak isolation. Variables ($x$), Integer and boolean
constants ($k$), records ($r$) of named constants, sets ($s$) of such
records, arithmetic and boolean expressions ($e_1 \odot e_2$), and
record expressions ($\{\bar{f}=\bar{e}\}$) constitute the syntactic
class of expressions ($e$). Commands ($c$) include $\cskip$,
conditional statements, \C{LET} constructs to bind names, \C{FOREACH}
loops, SQL statements, their sequential composition ($c_1;c_2$), and
transactions ($\ctxn{i}{\I}{c}$) and their parallel composition
($c_1\,||\,c_2$). The $\I$ in the \C{TXN} block syntax is the
transaction's isolation specification, which will be explained later.
Certain terms that only appear at run-time are also present in $c$.
These include a \R{TXN} block tagged with sets ($\stl$ and $\stg$) of
records whose meaning is explained below, and a runtime \R{FOREACH}
expression that keeps track of the set ($s_1$) of items already
iterated, and the set ($s_2$) of items yet to be iterated. Note that
even the surface-level syntax of the \C{FOREACH} command shown here is
a little different from the one used in previous sections; its
higher-order function has two arguments, $y$ and $z$, which are
invoked (during the reduction) with the set of already-iterated items,
and the current item, respectively. This form of \C{FOREACH} lends
itself to inductive reasoning that will be useful for verification
(Sec.~\ref{sec:reasoning}).

% also We let $T_i$ for $i \in \matshbb{N}$
% range over transaction identifiers. When it is evident we are
% referring to a transaction, we use the number $i$ instead of $T_i$ for
% identification (\eg in $\C{txn}\langle i \rangle$). Like variables,
% transaction identifiers are globally accessible. For notational
% convenience, we let $t$ range over both expressions and commands.

We define a small-step operational semantics for this language in
terms of an abstract machine that executes a command, and updates
either a transaction-local ($\stl$), or global ($\stg$) database, both
of which are modeled as a set of records of a pre-defined type, i.e.,
they all belong to a single table.  The generalization to multiple
tables is straightforward.  Records in $\stg$ are uniquely identifiable
through their $\idf$ field, which is auto-generated and does not
belong to the surface language, i.e., $\C{id}\notin f$. For a set $S$
of records, we define $\dom(S)$ as the set of unique ids of all 
records in $S$. Thus $|\dom(\stg)| = |\stg|$. During its execution, a
transaction may write to multiple records in $\stg$. Atomicity
dictates that such writes should not be visible in $\stg$ until the
transaction commits. We therefore associate each transaction with a
local database ($\stl$) that stores such uncommitted
records\footnote{While SQL's \C{UPDATE} admits writes at the
  granularity of record fields, databases, in reality, enforce
  record-level locking, allowing us to think of ``uncommitted writes''
  as ``uncommitted records''. }. Uncommitted records include deleted
records, which are identified by a hidden $\delf$ field set to
\C{true}. When the transaction commits, its local database is
atomically \emph{flushed} to the global database, committing these
heretofore uncommitted records. The flush operation ($\gg$) is defined as
follows:
\begin{smathpar}
\begin{array}{c}
\forall r.~ r \in (\stl\gg\stg) ~\Leftrightarrow~ 
  (r.\idf \notin \dom(\stl) \conj r \in \stg)
\disj (r \in \stl \conj \neg r.\delf) 
\end{array}
\end{smathpar}
Let $\stg' = \stl\gg\stg$. A record $r$ belongs to $\stg'$ iff it
belongs to $\stg$ and has not been updated in $\stl$, i.e., $r.\idf
\notin \dom(\stl)$, or it belongs to $\stl$, i.e., it is either a new
record, or an updated version of an old record, but the update is not
a deletion ($\neg r.\delf$). Thus, flush defines the result of
atomically applying a transaction's local writes to the global
database.  Besides the commit, flush also helps a transaction read its
own writes. Intuitively, the result of a read operation inside a
transaction must be computed on the database resulting from flushing
the current local state ($\stl$) to the global state ($\stg$). The
abstract machine of Fig.~\ref{fig:txnimp}, however, does not let a
transaction read its own writes. This simplifies the semantics,
without losing any generality, since substituting $\stl\gg\stg$ for
$\stg$ at select places in the reduction rules effectively allows
reads of uncommitted transaction writes to be realized.

The small-step semantics is stratified into a transaction-local reduction
relation, and a top-level reduction relation. Transaction-local
relation ($\stg \vdash (c,\stl) \stepsto (c',\stl')$) defines a
small-step reduction for a command inside a transaction, when the
database state is $\stg$; the command $c$ reduces to $c'$, while
updating the transaction-local database $\stl$ to $\stl'$. The
definition assumes a meta function $\eval$ that evaluates expressions
with no free variables to values. The reduction relation for SQL
statements is defined straightforwardly.  \C{INSERT} adds a new record
to $\stl$ after adding a unique identifier. \C{DELETE} finds the records in $\stg$ that match
the search criteria defined by its boolean function argument, and adds
the records to $\stl$ after marking them for deletion. \C{SELECT}
bounds the name introduced by \C{LET} to the set of records from
$\stg$ that match the search criteria, and then executes the bound
command $c$. \C{UPDATE} uses its first function argument to compute
the updated version of the records that match the search criteria
defined by its second function argument. Updated records are added to
$\stl$. 

The reduction of \C{FOREACH} starts by first converting it to its
run-time form to keep track of iterated items ($s_1$),
as well as  yet-to-be-iterated items ($s_2$). Initially, $s_1$ is
empty. As the elements are iterated, they are removed from $s_2$ and
added to $s_1$ . Iteration involves invoking its function argument
with $s_1$ and the current element $x$ (note: $\uplus$ in $\{x\}
\uplus s_2$ denotes a disjoint union). The reduction ends when 
$s_2$ becomes empty. The reduction rules for conditionals, \C{LET}
binders, and sequences are straightforward, and ommitted for brevity.

The top-level reduction relation defines the small-step semantics of
transactions, and their parallel composition. A transaction always
comes tagged with an isolation specification $\I_e$ or $\I_c$ that
dictates the timing and nature of interferences that a transaction can
witness, both during its execution ($\I_e$), and when it is about to
commit ($\I_c$).  Formally, $\I_e$ and $\I_c$ are functions that map
the (current) transaction-local database state ($\stl$), the state
($\stg$) of the global database when the transaction last took a step,
and the current state ($\stg'$) of the global database.  Intuitively,
$\stg'\neq\stg$ indicates an interference from another concurrent
transaction, and the predicates $\I_e$ and $\I_c$ decide if this
interference is allowed or not, taking into account the local database
state ($\stl$). For instance, as described in
(Sec.~\ref{sec:motivation}), an RR transaction on PostgreSQL defines
$\I$ as following:
\begin{smathpar}
\begin{array}{lcl}
\I_e\,\,(\stl,\stg,\stg') & = & \stg' = \stg\\
\I_c\,\,(\stl,\stg,\stg') & = & \forall(r\in\stl)(r'\in\stg).~ r'.\idf = r.\idf \Rightarrow r'\in\stg'.
\end{array}
\end{smathpar}

The reduction of a $\ctxn{i}{\I_e}{c}$ begins by first converting it
to its run-time form $\ctxn{i}{\I_e,\stl,\stg}{c}$, where $\stl =
\emptyset$, and $\stg$ the current (global) database.  Rule
\rulelabel{E-Txn} reduces $\ctxn{i}{\I_e,\stl,\stg}{c}$ under a
database state ($\stg'$), only if the isolation specification ($\I$)
allows the interference between $\stg$ and $\stg'$ during that
step. Rule \rulelabel{E-Commit} commits the transaction
$\ctxn{i}{\I_c,\stl,\stg}{c}$ by flushing its uncommitted records to
the database. This is done only if the interference between $\stg$ and
$\stg'$ is allowed at the commit point by the isolation specification.
The distinction between $\I_e$ and $\I_c$ allows us to model realistic
database features such as snapshot isolation that isolates the effects
a transaction can witness during its execution but exposes
interferences from concurrent transactions at the commit point.
